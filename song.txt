You may say that I'm a dreamer
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new

I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan



You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yeah, she caught my eye
As we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment
That will last 'til the end
