We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money"

Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
